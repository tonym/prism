# `@prism/shared`

`@prism/shared` contains foundational utilities, common types, helpers, and low-level building blocks used across the Prism workspace.

While `@prism/blueprints` defines the *contracts* and `@prism/pipelines` defines the *logic*, the shared package provides the *infrastructure primitives* needed everywhere else.

It is intentionally lightweight, stable, and dependency-minimal.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The shared package exists to centralize reusable logic that is **not** domain-specific, **not** pipeline-specific, and **not** tied to any external service.

It provides:

### **1. Utility functions**
Small pieces of generic logic reused across packages, such as:

- safe JSON helpers  
- object/array manipulation  
- functional utilities  
- type guards  
- string and text helpers  

These are used broadly across adapters, pipelines, CLI tooling, and evals.

---

### **2. Common TypeScript types**
Strong typing is core to Prism’s safety model.

Shared provides:

- generic utility types  
- error types  
- result wrappers  
- discriminated unions  
- async helpers  
- common interface patterns  

These form the baseline for consistent TypeScript structure throughout the codebase.

---

### **3. Cross-package helpers**
Anything used by multiple packages but not specific to any one of them lives here.

Examples include:

- environment/config helpers  
- stable timestamp or UUID helpers  
- small pure functions  
- formatting utilities  

Keeping these centralized keeps duplication low and consistency high.

---

### **4. Zero external dependencies**
This package intentionally does **not** wrap third-party APIs or SDKs.  
That is the responsibility of `@prism/adapters`.

Shared remains clean and deterministic.

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

### **Minimal**
Only add things truly reused across packages.

### **Stable**
Changes here affect the whole workspace — consistency is key.

### **Pure**
Shared functions should avoid side effects and external dependencies.

### **Compositional**
Primitives should compose cleanly rather than attempt to be frameworks.

---

## 🔮 Future Directions

Possible expansions include:

- richer functional utility helpers  
- consistent error taxonomy shared across the workspace  
- reusable retry/backoff primitives (pure, adapter-agnostic)  
- lightweight structured logging helpers  
- schema utilities compatible with blueprints  

---

## Summary

`@prism/shared` is the foundation layer of Prism.

It provides:

- reusable utilities  
- common types  
- pure helpers  
- stable, dependency-free primitives  

Every other package in the monorepo can rely on `shared` without pulling in complexity.
